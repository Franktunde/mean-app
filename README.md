LEARNING DIARY, <SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT SKILLS: FULLSTACK 2022-23> MODULE




 
LEARNING DIARY

EXAMPLE STYLE 1
5.11.2022

I checked the general information and understood the main focus of the course, which is to find my passion as a software developer and create a unique project to represent my skills. I chose frontend module because it was the most interesting project offered. I’ve also tried to set up my environment, but I could not decide which code editor I would like to use.  I learned to set up a git repository and did my first commit, everything went smoothly after I clicked the banner to watch intro to GIT.  

8.11.2022

I have chosen VS Code as my code editor for this course, I learned how to set up addons by googling how to do it. I searched the web for best addons and chose the best addons that I think fits me best.  I started to watch the first part of the example project to understand the technologies better.

I did my second commit but somehow it did not go as I planned. I went to stackoverflow and found quite many threads about version control problems. I was able to figure out what was the problem and continued to watch the first part till the end.
 
EXAMPLE STYLE 2

10.11.2022

I learned about,

version control, but mostly it was just refreshing my memory. What I learned was…

how to develop as a becoming software professional. I find software developement interesting, because there’s a lot of change you can make to the world behind your screen.

How to setup mongodb environment. I learnt how to do this on this project lesson in which I missed a detail of not installing mongodb exe file which led to my backend not connecting to the mongodb database.

Etc.

EXAMPLE STYLE 3
12.11.2022

Freeform.

How to run project:
#clone this repository with git clone then the preferred cloning method( http/ssh)
#open with vscode.
#open vscode terminal.
#run npm install .. to install and nodemodule packages.
#run ng build in the angular-src file to build project.
#project can be seen in the angular-src/public folder.
#open the index.html file in the angular-src/public folder.

Something else, but reasonable. You must document what you have done, learned and when this have happened.
I also learnt how to used postman to test my backend urls on localhost
